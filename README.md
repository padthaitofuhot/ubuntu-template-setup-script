# Ubuntu Template Setup Script
*A simple setup script for Ubuntu templates.*

# Lore
This is intended for use within a digital playground I've been building out for some local nerds doing IT skill shares.  Maybe you'll find your own use for it.  The scenario this solves is where one has a pre-configured Ubuntu image and wants to quickly and interactively uniquify and configure it with the basics:
* Change password
* Set hostname
* Uniqify the machine-id
* Uniqify SSH host identities
* Configure the network (using **netplan**)

# Using
Just run it, preferably with sudo.
